        <h1>How to add licenses and upgrade your <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> account to <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> Plus</h1>
        <p>Get the most out of your <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> account by upgrading to <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> Plus. You can add licenses to your account or upgrade to <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> Plus directly from your web-based Admin Area to access new features like real-time session monitoring, registry editing, or batch scripting. </p>
        <p class="nugget">Only <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> users who purchased <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> or <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> Plus online, using the e-commerce process are able to add licenses from within the product. Users who originally purchased <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> through a sales representative will need to <a href="Billing-info.htm">call their Sales rep to add licenses</a>. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Log in to the <a href="https://admin.swi-tc.com/admin_area_/login.php" target="_blank">web-based Admin Area</a> of your <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> account. </li>
            <li>From the navigation options on the left of the screen select <b>Management</b> &gt; <b>Licenses</b>. </li>
            <p class="warning">The Primary Account Holder is the only user with permission to access the Licensing Information section of <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" />. </p>
            <li>Select the <b>Details</b> tab to view the licensing information for your account. Here you can see when your account is up for renewal, the total number of concurrent and End User licenses, and the maximum number of Unattended Agents you can install on your customers' devices. <br /><img src="Resources/Images/MSPanywhere/UpgradeTCPlus.png" /></li>
            <li>When you are ready to upgrade your <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> account to a <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> Plus account, click <b>Upgrade</b>. To add more licenses to your account, click <b>Add licenses</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Both the <b>Upgrade</b> and <b>Add licenses</b> buttons open a new tab in your browser, where you are navigated through a shortened version of the e-commerce process. Finishing this process completes your account upgrade or addition of new licenses. </p>
        <p class="info">All annual licenses renew on the same date! If you upgrade an annual license, you will be charged the difference between the price of Take Control and Take Control Plus, and that difference will be pro-rated for the remainder of the annual term. Your renewal date does not change and all annual licenses renew on the same date. </p>
