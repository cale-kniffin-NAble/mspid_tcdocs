        <h1>Create and manage technicians</h1>
        <p>Create accounts for new technicians, configure their permissions and default settings, and adjust permissions as needed for existing technicians. From the Technicians management section of the Admin Area, you can enable or disable technicians as needed, and grant or take away permissions. This is helpful for setting up new technicians, or if a quick downgrade or upgrade to a technician's account is necessary.</p>
        <p>You can also add customers as <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> users and limit their access permissions to specific areas of your account. Use the Permissions tab to control access globally, or just in the Admin Area or Tech Console. </p>
        <p>Watch <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUAQPKmT92A&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">this video</a></b> to learn more about creating new technicians for your <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> account. </p>
