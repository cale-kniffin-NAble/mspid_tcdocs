        <h1>Enable Multifactor authentication</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> requires Multifactor authentication (MFA) be enabled on all Master and Admin accounts in order to access the Technician Console and Admin Area. It is strongly suggested that Technician and End user accounts enable MFA as well.</p>
        <p>The MFA  feature is one of the simplest and most robust Multifactor authentication methods you can use to provide another layer of security to your <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> account and help guard against cyber threats. </p>
        <p>After you have enabled MFA, the second authentication method is triggered after the username and password have been validated. The authenticator application that the user has installed is triggered to generate a 6-digit code that the user must enter in order to validate their identity. </p>
        <p>If you have not enabled MFA on your <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> account, when you log into the Admin Area or Technician Console, you will receive a prompt to do so. </p>
        <p class="warning">MFA is mandatory for all  Master and Admin accounts.  It is strongly recommended (but not mandatory) for Technicians and End Users.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select <b>Enable Multifactor Authentication </b> after logging in to your <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> Admin Area or Tech Console. Depending on your role, you will receive a different message - Technicians have the option to continue to their account without setting up MFA, but  Master and Admin accounts must enable MFA in order to log in to their account. <br /><img src="Resources/Images/MSPanywhere/MFA_for_Techs.png" style="border-left-style: solid;border-left-width: 1px;border-left-color: ;border-right-style: solid;border-right-width: 1px;border-right-color: ;border-top-style: solid;border-top-width: 1px;border-top-color: ;border-bottom-style: solid;border-bottom-width: 1px;border-bottom-color: ;width: 317px;height: 337px;" /> <img src="Resources/Images/MSPanywhere/MFA_for Master-Admin.png" style="width: 326px;height: 339px;" /></li>
            <li>Use your phone or tablet to download and install the appropriate authenticator for your device type. After the download is complete, click <b>Next</b>.<br /><img src="Resources/Images/MSPanywhere/2FAstep2.png" style="width: 302px;height: 371px;" /></li>
            <li>To finalize the setup process, open the downloaded authentication app and scan the QR code, or enter the secure code manually. Click <b>Confirm Setup</b>.<br /><img src="Resources/Images/MSPanywhere/2FAQRcode.png" style="width: 213px;height: 408px;" /></li>
            <li> In the final step, copy your Recovery Code and save it in a secure location. Click <b>Complete setup</b> to activate Multifactor authentication for your <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> account. <br /><img src="Resources/Images/MSPanywhere/2FARecoveryCode.png" style="width: 304px;height: 328px;" /></li>
        </ol>
        <p>After MFA is enabled, all login attempts for your account will only be successful with the input of your Username, Password and Authenticator code. MFA adds a powerful layer of security that will help keep your account, and your clients, safe from password attacks.<br /></p>
