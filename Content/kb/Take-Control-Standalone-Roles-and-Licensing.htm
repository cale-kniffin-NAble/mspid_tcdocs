This role manages the configuration and reporting aspects of Take Control by leveraging the <a href="https://admin.swi-tc.com/admin_area_/login.php" target="_blank">Admin Area</a>. There is no licensing for this use of the <a href="https://admin.swi-tc.com/admin_area_/login.php" target="_blank">Admin Area</a> (provided Remote Control Mode is not enabled), therefore Administrators can use the Admin Area regardless of how many other technicians may be logged in at any given time.<ul><li>The Main (or Master) Administrator is the login created with the account, this role has significant privileges and permissions that cannot be revoked or changed;</li><li>Administrators have all the privileges afforded to Technicians;</li><li>Note that an Administrator that enables Remote Access Mode in the Admin Area will have their login require an available license.</li></ul></li><li>Technicians - This is the operational role, users that provide remote support within the Support Organization, either to external customers or other internal users.<ul><li>There is no limit to the number of Technicians you can create, only how many of them can be logged in simultaneously;</li><li>Technicians use the Desktop or Mobile Tech Console, a native application available for the major platforms, or the Admin Area in Remote Access Mode to provide support;</li><li>Take Control licensing is directly tied to the number of Technicians using the Desktop Console, Mobile Console or Remote Access Mode: you will need a license per simultaneous login to either of these options, even if no remote session is open;</li><li>The licensing is concurrent, meaning that you don't have licenses assigned to specific technicians, instead it's managed by simultaneous logins;<ul><li>For example, if you've purchased 5 licenses, you can have up to 5 simultaneous logins from any number of technicians to either the desktop console, mobile console or remote access through the admin area.</li></ul></li><li>Each technician can be logged into a (Windows or macOS) Desktop Console, an (Android or iOS) Mobile Console and the Admin Area's Remote Access mode simultaneously and with the same login - provided sufficient licenses are available;</li><li>It is not possible to login to two of the same Console type simultaneously.</li></ul></li><li>Customers - These are the users that receive remote support. They run either the Applet or the Agent. These sessions don't require additional licensing, however the Agent install limit is linked to the number of Technician licenses (500 per <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName_tcp_short" /> license and 50 per Take Control license), there is no limit for Applets.<ul><li>Applets do not install or run as a service and are intended to be used for Attended Support sessions;</li><li>Agents are a permanent install on the remote end and do run as a service, they are intended for Unattended Support sessions;</li><li>Each <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName_tcp_short" /> license allows the Support Organization to deploy the Agent in up to 500 devices while each Take Control license allows the deployment of the Agent in up to 50 devices;<ul><li>Note that you can delete devices from your device list to make room for new installs.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>End Users - These are internal or external users to the Support Organization that can take advantage of the deployed agents to connect to their work PC using Take Control. People with End User logins can't use the Tech Console but must use a dedicated web area instead, called <a href="https://admin.corporate.beanywhere.com/client_area/login.php" target="_blank">End User Area</a>. Each End User login is entitled to access up 10 computers (with the Agent installed):<ul><li>Each <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName_tcp_short" /> license allows the Support Organization to 10 End User licenses, with each End User being limited to up to 10 devices. An End User license is required for each End User login created</li><li>Note that the End User feature is only available with the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName_tcp_short" /> license.</li></ul></li></ul></div> <div id="internal"> <div MadCap:conditions="Default.Ignore"><p><b>Article Number:</b> 129944</p><p><b>Internal notes:</b> Reviewed in 2017 Purge - No Changes Needed</p><p /></div></div> </div> </body>
