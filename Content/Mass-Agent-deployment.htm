        <h1>Mass Management of installed <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> Agents</h1>
        <p>For Partners who leverage <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> Agents for unattended access, you now have the ability to deploy security settings to a large number of agents all at the same time without the need to reinstall the Agent. </p>
        <p class="info">If your company operates within a compliance sensitive environment, these added settings could potentially compromise compliance and can not be administratively disabled.</p>
