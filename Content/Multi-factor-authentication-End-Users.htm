        <h1>Multifactor Authentication for End Users</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> strongly recommends that Multifactor authentication (MFA) be enabled on your account in order to access the End User Area. </p>
        <p>After MFA is enabled, and your username and password have been validated, the second authentication method is triggered when you log in to the End User Area. At that point, the system requires an additional 6-digit token generated by the authenticator app that you downloaded to your desktop or mobile device.</p>
        <p class="nugget">Note to MSPs: New End Users will receive an email with instructions on how to log in to the End User Area, and a second email when they activate MFA for their End User Area. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>After logging in to the End User Area, the end user receives a message to enable MFA for their account. Select <b>Two Factor Authentication</b> to activate MFA, or click <b>Continue</b> to configure MFA later. Messaging will continue until MFA is enabled.<br /><img src="Resources/Images/MSPanywhere/MFA_EndUserMessage.png" /> </li>
            <li>A new tab in your browser opens to begin the MFA setup process. Use your phone or tablet to download and install the appropriate authenticator for your device type. After the download is complete, click <b>Next</b>.<br /><img src="Resources/Images/MSPanywhere/2FAstep2.png" style="width: 299px;height: 367px;" /></li>
            <li>To finalize the set up process, open the downloaded authenticator app and scan the QR code, or enter the secure code manually. Click <b>Confirm Setup</b>.<br /><img src="Resources/Images/MSPanywhere/2FAQRcode.png" style="width: 247px;height: 474px;" /></li>
            <li> In the final step, copy your Recovery Code and save it in a secure location. Click <b>Complete setup</b> to activate Multifactor authentication for your <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> End User account. <br /><img src="Resources/Images/MSPanywhere/2FARecoveryCode.png" style="width: 304px;height: 328px;" /></li>
        </ol>
        <p>After MFA is enabled, all login attempts to the End User Area will only be successful with the input of your Username, Password and Authenticator code.</p>
