        <h1>Create an end user</h1>
        <p>End-Users are counted apart from your normal technician licensing, for example you can have a license for 1 Corporate Technician and 10 licenses for end users. Configure your customers as End Users to give them restricted access to their computers and devices with a limited set of features and permissions.</p>
        <p>End Users cannot access the Admin Area or any of the Consoles, and are limited to their own <a href="Access-end-user-area.htm">End User Area</a> where they have limited access to a number of devices and can perform basic remote control and file transfer tasks. </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">From the Admin Area, Navigate to <b>Management</b> &gt; <b>Technicians</b>, and click <b>Add</b>. </li>
            <li>Enter the Name and Email for the end user,  select <b>Configure as End User</b> and click&#160;<b>Save</b>. </li>
            <li>Click <b>Send invitation</b> to send the SSO (Single Sign On) invitation to the end user. </li>
            <p class="info">The new end user will receive an email with instructions on how to set up their SSO account and log in to the End User area. </p>
            <li value="3">The Permissions and Default Settings tabs are replaced with the Customers tab, where you can choose which devices the end user can access. Select the <b>Computers</b> tab, and use the <b>Custom Name</b> field to change the name of each computer to which the end user has access. </li>
            <li value="4">Save your changes. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="warning">The usage of the End-User licensing is subject to a Fair Usage Policy which is regularly updated. See <a href="[%=URLs.CompanyURL%]products/take-control" target="_blank">the <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> website</a> for more information.</p>
