        <h1>End-User Accounts</h1>
        <p>End-Users are special types of accounts that are converted from technician accounts, and have limited access to a number of devices through a special Web area.  End users  are restricted to the <a href="https://enduser.swi-tc.com/login.php" target="_blank">End User Area </a>where they can only access  devices to which they have been granted permission. This allows you to provide access to your customers and their devices, from a web portal accessible from anywhere, as long as you have an internet connection.</p>
        <p>This type of account gives your customers the ability to remotely access their own devices using the <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> Agent. During remote access, these users are limited to Chat, Remote Desktop, and File Transfer. </p>
