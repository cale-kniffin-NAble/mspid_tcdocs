        <h1>Create End User accounts in Take Control</h1>
        <p>End-User accounts are a special type of <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> users that are converted from technician accounts, and have limited access to a number of devices through a special web portal called the End User Area.  End User  accounts are restricted to the <a href="https://enduser.swi-tc.com/login.php" target="_blank">End User Area </a>where they can only access  devices to which they have been granted permission. </p>
        <p>After downloading the <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> Viewer, End Users can remotely access their computers and devices, and open Deferred Support Requests for any of those devices. During remote access, these users are limited to the Remote Desktop, and File Transfer tabs, as well as the Computer, Session, View, Commands, and Interactions menus in the Viewer. </p>
        <p>To get started creating End Users, add a new technician to your account. </p>
        <h2>Add a technician to your account and configure them as an End-User</h2>
        <p>End-Users are counted apart from your normal technician licensing, for example you can have a license for 1 Corporate Technician and 10 licenses for end users. </p>
        <p>Configure your customers as End Users to give them restricted access to their computers and devices with a limited set of features and permissions.</p>

            <li>After saving the End User, the Permissions and Default Settings tabs of the Technician Configuration window are replaced with the Computers tab, where you can choose which devices the End User can access. Select the <b>Computers</b> tab, and use the <b>Custom Name</b> field to change the name of each computer to which the end user has access. Each device's Custom Name is  displayed  in the End User area. <br /><img src="Resources/Images/MSPanywhere/EndUserComputerAccess.png" style="border-left-style: solid;border-left-width: 1px;border-left-color: ;border-right-style: solid;border-right-width: 1px;border-right-color: ;border-top-style: solid;border-top-width: 1px;border-top-color: ;border-bottom-style: solid;border-bottom-width: 1px;border-bottom-color: ;" /></li>

        <p>The new end user will receive an Enrollment Notification email and they can use the <b>Create Login</b> button in the email to set their password and create their new <MadCap:variable name="General.Company_sso" /> account. After the new SSO account is created, the end user is prompted to download the <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> Viewer in order to access the computers to which they were granted access. </p>
        <p> This automatically logs the user into the End User area where they can view the devices to which they were granted permission to access.</p>
